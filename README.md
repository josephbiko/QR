## How to start

Please, try to use Python 3.6 or above to run our code.

Please, see the `requirements.txt` to download a couple of packages from `pip` that might be missing from your python/conda environment.
Please note that an working installation of graphviz on your system is also required.

In order to run the program you could run main.py with the command.

>>> python main.py

Thus, you will run the simulation with the default set-up (see `qr.yaml` to change the set-up). You can see results in the root folder: the state graph in 'Digraph.gv.png' together with the visual trace. To see the trace in text format see 'Digraph.gv'.
